 * Uploads to an existing record in the specified table with binary data (maximum size 128 MB).
 * Content type header must be application/octet-stream, and the binary data should be provided directly (e.g., as a Uint8Array or other binary type). This API is intended for use with file columns in Dataverse, and will not work with other column types.
 * For file columns in Dataverse, the recordId is the ID of the Dataverse record, and the tableName is the logical name of the Dataverse table.
 * See documentation for more details:

 * @param dataSourcesInfo - The data sources information.
 * @param tableName - The name of the table to upload the record in.
 * @param recordId - The ID of the record to upload.
 * @param columnName - The name of the file column to upload to.
 * @param fileName - The name of the file to upload (used for Dataverse file columns).
 * @param data - The body of the request which should have the binary contents of the file to upload.
 * @returns - A promise that resolves to an operation result indicating success or failure of the upload.
